## Markdown Example - Turbo Encabulator

#### Issue: 

The first version of the machine had a base-plate of prefabulated aluminite, surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the **2** main spurving bearings were in a direct line with the pentametric fan. 


The latter consisted simply of **six** hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented. 

```py
#lotus-o-delta algorithm
for i in range(7):
    tremie_pipe += gridlespring + 0.5*marzlevane[i]
```
#### Solution:

The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic semi-bovoid slots in the stator, every **seventh** conductor being connected by a non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential girdlespring on the "_up_" end of the grammeters.
