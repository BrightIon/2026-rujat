# feedback-and-locking
We will discuss feedback controllers in general, PID loops and how to tune them, analog and digital implementations with software and with physical hardware, locking to a reference - particularly laser locking using high bandwith schemes.

> This is a mini-course for experimental physicists, prepared by Sam Hile around 2023, in the context of the IQT research group at Sussex. It normally involves ~4hrs of interactive lecture/discussion to cover the content. To properly master the ideas, learners should spend probably twice that much time reading further and exploring the topics on their own.

## Contents
1.	Generic process control theory
2.	Human intuition (timescale)
3.	P, I, and D equations
5.	Tuning procedures
6.	Testing/verifying parameter stability and impulse response
7.	Example 1: a course laser wavelength lock
8.	Lock-in detection
9.	PDH error signals
10.	Analog circuitry for near-instant response
11.	Example 2: Toptica FALC
12.	Digital processing and FPGA control
13.	Example 3: Sinara Suservo
